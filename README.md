# Odin exercice: Landing page

This project is part of the [Odin's Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject) *Foundations* course.

The goal here is to train the skills learned so far by creating a landing page from scratch, based on a provided mockup. It's a simple exercice to check your knowledge of HTML and CSS.

See live example [here](https://ngoosen.github.io/odin_landing_page/).
